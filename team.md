# Potential Roadblocks

1. Technical issues: As with any software development project, technical issues such as bugs, integration challenges, or performance problems can arise, potentially causing delays or requiring additional resources to address.
2. Scope creep: It's easy for project requirements to expand beyond the original plan, resulting in scope creep. This can cause the project to take longer than anticipated and increase costs.
3. Stakeholder conflicts: Disagreements between project stakeholders, such as users, developers, and management, can lead to delays, reduced motivation, or a lack of consensus on project direction.
4. Lack of resources: Limited resources, such as budget, staff, or technical expertise, can affect the ability to complete the project on time and to the desired quality.
5. Security and compliance issues: Ensuring that the platform is secure and complies with relevant regulations, such as data privacy laws, can be challenging and time-consuming.
